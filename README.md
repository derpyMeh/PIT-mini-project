# PIT mini project
Requirements:
VR Headset (disable the device simulator in hierarchy) or Keybaord/Mouse (using the Device Simulator).

Unity Version: 2022.3.10f1

No additional libraries beyond what is contained in the github repository should be necessary.

Start game by hitting Unity's Play button (remember to enabled or disable the device simulator in the hierarchy accordingly).
There is a gun on the floor to the left of the player's spawn location, which can be picked up and fired at the enemies using the trigger button.
There are waypoints located throughout the playfield allowing the user to teleport to them.
Coming into contact with 10 enemies will kill the player.
